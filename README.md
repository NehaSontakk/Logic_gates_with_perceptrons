Logic Gates using Neural Networks


## McCulloch-Pitts Neuron

Two parts, g and f. \
If 'x' values represent all the inputs. \
g takes the inputs performs an aggregation function (x1+x2+x3...) on all the inputs. \
f makes a decision based on output of g.

###### AND Logic Gate

An AND function neuron fires only if ALL inputs are 1.

###### OR Logic Gate

Neuron fires if ANY of the inputs are 1.

###### NOT Logic Gate

Take input as inhibitory function and our threshold is zero.
